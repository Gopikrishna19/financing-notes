Absolutely! Here's the correct table with each transaction properly applied to **A = L + E** (Assets = Liabilities + Equity). Iâ€™ll walk you through the changes so that the equation balances at each step.

### **Step-by-step Table for A = L + E**

| Date       | Assets ($)             | Liabilities ($)        | Equity ($)   | Explanation                                                        |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Start**  | 0                      | 0                      | 0            | Starting point, no transactions yet                                 |
| **Aug 1-3**| +27 (Inventory)         | +27 (Accounts Payable) | 0            | Purchased inventory on credit ($27)                                |
| **Aug 31** | 27 (Inventory)          | +27 (Accounts Payable) | 0            | Statement received for $27 payable by Sep 22                        |
| **Sep 1**  | +225 (Accounts Receivable) | 0                    | +225 (Revenue) | Provided service, invoiced for $225 (increase in revenue & receivables) |
| **Sep 5**  | +225 (Cash), -225 (Accounts Receivable) | 0  | 0            | Payment received for invoice, increasing cash and reducing receivables |
| **Sep 15** | -27 (Cash)              | -27 (Accounts Payable) | 0            | Paid $27 credit card bill, reducing cash and accounts payable      |
| **Sep 30** | +10 (Inventory)         | +10 (Accounts Payable) | 0            | Bought writing pad on credit, increasing inventory and accounts payable |

### **Calculation for Final Totals:**

1. **Assets**:
   - **Inventory**: $27 (Aug 1-3) + $10 (Sep 30) = **$37**
   - **Accounts Receivable**: $225 (Sep 1) - $225 (Sep 5) = **$0**
   - **Cash**: $225 (Sep 5) - $27 (Sep 15) = **$198**
   
   **Total Assets** = $37 (Inventory) + $198 (Cash) = **$235**

2. **Liabilities**:
   - **Accounts Payable**: $27 (Aug 1-3) - $27 (Sep 15) + $10 (Sep 30) = **$10**

3. **Equity**:
   - **Revenue**: $225 (Sep 1) = **$225**

### **Final Equation**:

```math
\text{Assets} (235) = \text{Liabilities} (10) + \text{Equity} (225)
```

Now, **the equation is balanced**!
