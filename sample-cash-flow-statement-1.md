To convert the transactions from the above table into a **Statement of Cash Flows**, we'll need to focus on the **cash-related transactions**, as the statement of cash flows specifically reports cash inflows and outflows over a given period. The statement is typically divided into three main sections:

1. **Operating Activities**
2. **Investing Activities**
3. **Financing Activities**

In your example, we’ll identify the cash transactions under each of these categories.

### **Operating Activities:**
Operating activities represent the day-to-day cash inflows and outflows related to the core operations of the business. We look for **cash inflows** and **cash outflows** directly from the operations.

- **Sale of inventory (cash)**: Cash received from sales.
- **Payment of sales tax to government**: Cash outflow for sales tax.
- **Payment for inventory (from credit)**: Cash outflow for inventory payment (when accounts payable is settled).
- **Payment of operating expenses**: Cash outflow for business operating expenses.
- **Payment of accrued salaries** (when paid): Cash outflow for salaries.

### **Investing Activities:**
Investing activities involve cash flows from the purchase and sale of long-term assets like property, equipment, and investments.

- **Purchase of fixed asset (on credit)**: No cash flow here yet since it's a credit transaction (no immediate cash outflow).
- **Sale of assets** (if any): If you sold any long-term assets, this would generate a cash inflow.

### **Financing Activities:**
Financing activities are related to transactions involving the business's capital structure, such as borrowing or repaying loans, issuing equity, or paying dividends.

- **Loan received (cash)**: Cash inflow from a loan.
- **Issuance of common stock**: Cash inflow from issuing stock.
- **Dividend payment**: Cash outflow when dividends are paid.

### Now, let's create the **Statement of Cash Flows**:

### **Statement of Cash Flows for Single Owner Business**:

| **Cash Flows from Operating Activities**           | Amount  |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Sale of inventory (cash)                           | +500    |
| Payment of sales tax to government                 | -25     |
| Payment for inventory (from credit)                | -200    |
| Payment of operating expenses                      | -150    |
| Payment of accrued salaries (when paid)            | 0       |
| **Net Cash from Operating Activities**             | **+125** |

| **Cash Flows from Investing Activities**           | Amount  |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Purchase of fixed asset (on credit)                | 0       |
| **Net Cash from Investing Activities**             | **0**   |

| **Cash Flows from Financing Activities**           | Amount  |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Loan received (cash)                               | +1000   |
| Issuance of common stock                           | +500    |
| Dividend payment                                   | -100    |
| **Net Cash from Financing Activities**             | **+1400** |

### **Net Increase in Cash**:

- **Net Cash from Operating Activities**: **+125**
- **Net Cash from Investing Activities**: **0**
- **Net Cash from Financing Activities**: **+1400**

### **Net Increase in Cash**: 
```math
125 + 0 + 1400 = 1525
```

### **Beginning Cash**: 
Let's assume the beginning cash balance is **$0** (this is the starting point for simplicity).

### **Ending Cash Balance**: 
```math
\text{Beginning Cash} + \text{Net Increase in Cash} = 0 + 1525 = 1525
```

---

### Final **Statement of Cash Flows**:

| **Cash Flows from Operating Activities** | **+125**   |
|------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Cash Flows from Investing Activities** | **0**      |
| **Cash Flows from Financing Activities** | **+1400**  |
| **Net Increase in Cash**                 | **+1525**  |
| **Beginning Cash**                       | **0**      |
| **Ending Cash Balance**                  | **+1525**  |

### Notes:
- Cash flows related to accrued salaries and tax payments are only recorded when the **cash** is actually paid out (i.e., when the liability is settled).
- Non-cash transactions like the purchase of fixed assets on credit and accrued salaries don’t affect the **cash flow** directly. They affect **assets**, **liabilities**, and **equity** on the balance sheet but not the **cash flow** statement.

This is the **simplified version** of the statement, and you can adapt it based on your specific situation or more detailed transactions. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!
